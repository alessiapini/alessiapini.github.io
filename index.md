# Research interests

My research has been largely focussed on nonparametric local inference for functional data. Specifically, I am interested into testing hypotheses on functional data, and to selecting the portions of the domain responsible for the rejection of a null hypothesis. 
I have been working with multiple testing issues, with a focus on the control of family wise error rate, and false discovery rate. I worked on the extensions of such concepts to the case of functional data, where a continuous infinity of tests are performed.
I am currently working on the extension of such methods to object data, i.e., complex data that cannot be straightforwardly embedded in Euclidean or Hilbertian spaces (e.g., density functions, networks).
