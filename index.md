# Research interests

My research is largely focussed on nonparametric inference for functional and complex data, on both a global and a local perspective. 
Specifically, I am interested into testing hypotheses on functional data (global tests), and to selecting the portions of the domain responsible for the rejection of a null hypothesis (local tests). 
I have been working with multiple testing issues, with a focus on the control of family wise error rate, and false discovery rate, and on the extensions of such concepts to the case of functional data, where a continuous infinity of tests are performed.
I am also interested in nonparametric inferential methods for complex data such as functional data defined on manifold domains, density functions, and networks. 
Finally, I am currently working on parametric and nonparametric inferential methods for the correlation structure of functional data along the domain.
